# Registers
These are temporary storage locations for data that the CPU actively uses.
They can hold instructions, memory addresses, or data values for calculations.

* Built directly into the CPU. 
* Fastest type of storage
* Very small capacity (typically a few to 64 bits)
* Volatile. Data is lost on power off
* Typically used to hold data and instructions during processing
* Crucial for efficient computer operations
    * allows the CPU to quickly access and manipulate data without relying on slower main memory (RAM)
