# CPU
aka **Central Processing Unit**

A computer system is much like a human body. It has many systems, each in charge of performing different tasks. The digestive system absorbs nutrients from the food. It also works together with the excretory system to remove waste. But they would not be able to function without the nervous system.

Much like the Central Nervous System to the body, the CPU is like the nervous system of a computer. Likewise, it sends the signals to trigger different components (organs) of the computer system (body) to perform various tasks. 

## Core
This is the fundamental processing unit of a CPU. Most modern CPUs usually contain a few of these [IC chips](/reference.md#chips). You can think of this as the brain of the nervous system. Although these days, CPUs (nervous systems) commonly have 8 cores (brains).

### Fetch-Decode-Execute-Writeback (FDEW) cycle
aka Instruction Cycle

Each core is continuously executing the FDEW cycle at extremely fast speeds, repeating billions of times per second.
