# CPU
aka **Central Processing Unit**

A computer system is much like a human body. It has many systems, each in charge of performing different tasks. The digestive system absorbs nutrients from the food. It also works together with the excretory system to remove waste. But they would not be able to function without the nervous system.

Much like the Central Nervous System to the body, the CPU is like the nervous system of a computer. Likewise, it sends the signals to trigger different components (organs) of the computer system (body) to perform various tasks. 


<!-- ## Core
This is the fundamental processing unit of a CPU. Most modern CPUs usually contain a few of these [IC chips](/reference.md#chips). You can think of this as the brain of the nervous system. Although these days, CPUs (nervous systems) commonly have 8 cores (brains).

### Fetch-Decode-Execute-Writeback (FDEW) cycle
aka Instruction Cycle

Each core is continuously executing the FDEW cycle at extremely fast speeds, repeating billions of times per second.

    * the **Program Counter** is a crucial [**register**](./Types-of-storage.md#register) within the CPU.  -->


## CPU's Hardware
Let's begin with a dive into the physical components within the CPU, from the outer layer.

### Let's all remain cool here, and nobody gets hurt
On top sits a protective cover, called an **Integrated Heat Spreader**. It's usually made of copper or aluminum. Underneath that is another protective metal plate which houses the actual CPU printed on a PCB, also known as the **Die**. Because the tiny CPU is the brain of an entire computer system, it generates tons of heat! To offset the entire processor melting, certain *heat dissipation* techniques are used. The heat from the CPU is directed up to the heat spreader through a conducive *thermal paste*. The thermal paste and heat spreader work as very conducive materials to dissipate heat to the **Heat Sink** which sits above it all, which is itself another sandwich with thermal paste in the center. If we're comparing this to the human body, this would be the body's thermoregulatory system.

### The Die
This is the actual raw, [Integrated Circuit Chip](../reference.md#chips). This is the actual brain.
