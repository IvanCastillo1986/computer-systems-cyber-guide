# Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)
This is the form of memory used in **caches**. 

That is in contrast to [DRAM](./DRAM.md), which uses an electrical charge within capacitors, with a transistor opening and closing the gate. Because the transistor is never fully closed, the energy leaks out and the capacitors keep needing to be refreshed with new electrical power.
