# SATA
The Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) interface is a widely used computer bus interface for connecting storage devices to a computer's motherboard.
These devices can be:
* Hard Disk Drives
* Solid State Drives
* Optical Drives

This standard replaces the older Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) interface, which provided slower transfer speeds and outdated features (such as bigger cables). PATA used wide ribbon cables and a parallel data transfer method, which was more susceptible to interference. It also limited the cable length. 

SATA instead uses a serial communication method. Through this manner, you only have one data line transferring 1 bit at a time. It might seem counter-intuitive, but this allows for higher transfer rates. 


## Why would SATA be more efficient than PATA?
Serial communication became the standard for a few reasons:
