# Electronic Components
This page attempts to cover the common elements of a computer's circuit board.

## Power Source
This provides the electrical energy that drives electrons.<br>
Examples:<br>
* Battery (Direct Current)
* Power Supply (converts AC to DC)
* Generator (Alternating Current)

## Conductor
This provides a path for the electrical current (electrons) to flow from the power source to the components and back.<br>
Examples:<br>
* Wires
* Traces on a PCB

## Load
This is the part of the circuit that uses the electrical energy and converts it into another form of energy (light, heat, motion, sound). It's the reason that the circuit exists.<br>
Examples:<br>
* Light bulb (light and heat energy)
* Motor (mechanical motion energy)
* Heater (heat energy)
* Speaker (sound energy)

## Switch
This allows you to open (break) or close (complete) a circuit.<br>
Examples:<br>
* Toggle Switch
* Push Button
* Relay

## Resistor
This opposes the flow of current in a circuit.<br>
They can be used to:<br>
* limit current
* divide voltage
* generate heat

## Capacitor
This component stores electrical energy in an electric field.<br>
They can be used for:<br>
* filtering
* smoothing voltage
* timing

Dielectric - an insulating material placed between capacitor plates. It's crucial for increasing capacitance, enhancing breakdown voltage, and proper plate separation.

## Inductor
This component stores energy in a magnetic field when current flow through it.<br>
They are used in:<br>
* filters
* power supplies
* in conjuction with capacitors in resonant circuits

## Diode
This is a semi-conductor device that allows current to flow primarily in one direction.<br>
They are used for:<br> 
* rectification (converting AC to DC)
* voltage regulation
* protection

## Transistor
This is a semi-conductor device that can act as an electronic switch or amplifier.<br>
They are used in almost every modern electronic device.
